# IP Addressing (IPv4)

Sample IP: 203.0.113.10


| Network Portion        | Host Portion           | 
| ------------- |-------------|
| 203.0.113        |             10  |
| Like zip code                 | Like street and number                | 

Binary format is: 
11001011 00000000 01110001 00001010

Every 8 bits is called octet.

## Classless addressing (~1995 to present)

Subnet mask tells us which portion of IP address is network and which portion is host. **Subnet mask does not have to fall every 8 bits!**

## Classful addressing (~1995 and prior)

Here subnet mask does not exist!

## Address Types

* Network Address
  * Identifier for a group of devices
  * "Network prefix"
  * Network address has zeros on host address portion
  ![netowrking-09-netowrk-address.png](images/netowrking-09-netowrk-address.png)
* Broadcast address
  * Identifier for all devices on a network
  * Broadcast address has ones on host address portion
  ![netowrking-10-broadcast-address.png](images/netowrking-10-broadcast-address.png)
* Host Address
  * Identifies unique device on a network
  * Only this address can be assigned to a device (computer)
  * Everything expect all zeros or all ones in the host portion
  ![netowrking-11-host-address.png](images/netowrking-11-host-address.png)

**Devices that are in the same network can talk each other directly.**

Sample network address:
![netowrking-12-sample-network-address.png](images/netowrking-12-sample-network-address.png)

Sample host address:
![netowrking-13-sample-host-address.png](images/netowrking-13-sample-host-address.png)

## Private and Public Address

* Private IP address range (can be used in home network, work network)
  * 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
  * 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
  * 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

All other addresses are public.

## Classless Inter-Domain Routing Notation (CIDR)

It is length of network portion - amount of ones.

203.0.113.10/24 means that the mask is 255.255.255.0 because 24 ones:
1111111 11111111 11111111 00000000 gives 255.255.255.0.

## Making a subnet calculator

For available hosts we subtract 2 because all zeros and all ones are assigned to network address and broadcast address.

| Bits        | Available networks           | Available hosts  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 0          | 1    (2 pow 0)         | -  (1-2)        |
| 1          | 2    (2 pow 1)         | -  (2-2)       |
| 2          | 4    (2 pow 2)         | 2 (4-2)         |
| 3          | 8    (2 pow 3)         | 6 (8-2)         |
| 4          | 16             | 14 (6-2)         |
| 5          | 32             | 30         |
| 6          | 64             | 62         |
| 7          | 128             | 126         |
| 8          | 256             | 254         |
| 9          | 512             | 510         |
| 10          | 1024             | 1022         |

## Subnetting a network into smaller networks

We have to connect 8 offices together. ISP provides address range: 203.0.113.0/24 so the start address (network) is 203.0.113.0 and end address (broadcast) is 203.0.113.255. Using this range we have to create 8 sub-networks.

![netowrking-14-subnetting.png](images/netowrking-14-subnetting.png)

## Basic router/NAT operations

10.0.0.0/24 divide into 2 networks.
**Router job is to separate IP networks.**

![netowrking-15-router.png](images/netowrking-15-router.png)

![nat-28.png](images/nat-28.png)

## Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)

We have to configure such network having from ISP CIDR: 10.0.48.0/21.
![netowrking-16-many-networks.png](images/netowrking-16-many-networks.png)

From the diagram we see that we will need 13 networks:
8 (for hosts) + 4 (for 4 routers) + 1 (routers on the top) = 13. Because routers on the top are connected directly they are in the same network so there is no need for additional router.

From 10.0.48.0/21 we have 11 bits available:
![netowrking-17-many-networks.png](images/netowrking-17-many-networks.png)

From these 11 bits we need 4 bits to create 13 networks so in every network we will have only 7 bits for hosts so it means that in every network we can have maximum 126 hosts and this is not enough for this scenario - that`s why we have to use **VLSM**.

### Setting up VLSM Problem

Final network assignment:

![networking-27-assignment.png](images/networking-27-assignment.png)

# find port using nestat command

```
D:\>netstat -ano -p tcp | findstr 33714
  TCP    192.168.254.101:33714  3.235.96.62:443        CLOSE_WAIT      4184
```
Next we can find process name using command:
```
PS D:\> tasklist /fi "pid eq 4"

Image Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage
